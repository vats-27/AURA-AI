    Next start describing about the motivation of the meet (mainly describes the main objective of the meet)

    Next explain each thing that has been dicussed in the meet. How;s the work currently going on, and what issues are they currenly facing (if any)

    Next find out what task has been discussed that needs to be done. 

    and at last...Give the conclusion of the whole meet under the heading Conclusion
    (Conclusion)
